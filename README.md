# gardens

A project to see about making something in git(hub) that uses the structure of the tool as a limitation or as a guide for whatever the thing is. 

Maybe.

# All that I can think about at the moment is that something begins here, not necessarily a story but something that can develop in a way that has the structure of the git version control system imposed on it. I am thinking about a maze but that is because I do not have a proper understanding of the structure. It seems silly actually. The branching and forking is an ordinary structure to build a narrative through. Maybe the functionality of git will be a useful influence on how the structure develops.

# There is another structure that imposes itself. Because git requires potential contributors to learn new terminology, new software, new user interfaces, [new structures]New-Structures.md), and all that, it will prevent some people from contributing. It creates a barrier between [some people](Some-People.md) and the gardens.
