# gardens

A project to see about making something in git(hub) that uses the structure of the tool as a limitation or as a guide for whatever the thing is. 

Maybe.

# All that I can think about at the moment is that something begins here, not necessarily a story but something that can develop in a way that has the structure of the git version control system imposed on it. I am thinking about a maze but that is because I do not have a proper understanding of the structure. It seems silly actually. The branching and forking is an ordinary structure to build a narrative through. Maybe the functionality of git will be a useful influence on how the structure develops.

There is another structure that imposes itself. Because git requires potential contributors to learn new terminology, new software, new user interfaces, new structures, and all that, it will prevent some people from contributing. It creates a barrier between some people and the gardens.
